This document provides a comprehensive guide on how to integrate our payment gateway into your client-side application.

## Prerequisites

Before integrating the payment gateway, ensure you have the following:

- An API key from your payment gateway account.
- Basic knowledge of JavaScript and front-end development.
- A client-side framework (e.g., React, Vue, Angular).

## Getting Started

### Step 1: Install the SDK

First, you need to install the payment gateway SDK. You can do this using npm or yarn.

```bash
npm install payment-gateway-sdk
```

Or 

```bash
yarn add payment-gateway-sdk
```

### Step 2: Initialize the SDK

Initialize the SDK with your API key. This can be done in your main application file.

```js 
import { PaymentGateway } from 'payment-gateway-sdk';

const paymentGateway = new PaymentGateway({
  apiKey: 'YOUR_API_KEY',
});
```

### Step 3: Create a Payment Form

Create a form to capture payment details from the user. The form should include fields for card number, expiry date, CVV, and any other required information.

```jsx 

import React, { useState } from 'react';

const PaymentForm = () => {
  const [cardNumber, setCardNumber] = useState('');
  const [expiryDate, setExpiryDate] = useState('');
  const [cvv, setCvv] = useState('');

  const handleSubmit = async (event) => {
    event.preventDefault();
    // Add payment processing logic here
  };

  return (
    <form onSubmit={handleSubmit}>
      <div>
        <label>Card Number</label>
        <input
          type="text"
          value={cardNumber}
          onChange={(e) => setCardNumber(e.target.value)}
        />
      </div>
      <div>
        <label>Expiry Date</label>
        <input
          type="text"
          value={expiryDate}
          onChange={(e) => setExpiryDate(e.target.value)}
        />
      </div>
      <div>
        <label>CVV</label>
        <input
          type="text"
          value={cvv}
          onChange={(e) => setCvv(e.target.value)}
        />
      </div>
      <button type="submit">Pay Now</button>
    </form>
  );
};

export default PaymentForm;

```

### Step 4: Process the Payment

Use the SDK to process the payment when the form is submitted.

```js

const handleSubmit = async (event) => {
  event.preventDefault();
  try {
    const paymentResult = await paymentGateway.processPayment({
      cardNumber,
      expiryDate,
      cvv,
    });
    if (paymentResult.success) {
      alert('Payment successful!');
    } else {
      alert('Payment failed: ' + paymentResult.error);
    }
  } catch (error) {
    alert('An error occurred: ' + error.message);
  }
};

```

### Step 5: Handle Payment Results

Ensure you handle both successful and failed payment attempts. Provide appropriate feedback to the user based on the payment result.

```js

if (paymentResult.success) {
  // Handle successful payment
} else {
  // Handle failed payment
}

```

### Additional Features

#### Handling Webhooks

To handle webhooks for real-time payment updates, refer to the server-side integration guide.

#### Saving Customer Information

To save customer payment information for future transactions, use the SDK's customer management features.

```js

const saveCustomerInfo = async () => {
  try {
    const customerResult = await paymentGateway.saveCustomer({
      cardNumber,
      expiryDate,
      cvv,
      customerId: 'CUSTOMER_ID',
    });
    if (customerResult.success) {
      alert('Customer information saved!');
    } else {
      alert('Failed to save customer information: ' + customerResult.error);
    }
  } catch (error) {
    alert('An error occurred: ' + error.message);
  }
};

```

Integrating the payment gateway into your client-side application is straightforward with our SDK. Follow the steps outlined in this guide to get started, and refer to the SDK documentation for more advanced features.
