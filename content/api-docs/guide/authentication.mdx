You'll need to authenticate your requests to access any of the endpoints in the API-DOC. In the guide, we'll look at how authentication works. API-DOC we offer two ways to authenticate your API requests: Basic authentication and OAuth2 with a token - OAuth2 is the recommended way


## Basic Authetication

Basic authentication involves sending a username and password with each request. While this method is straightforward, it's less secure compared to OAuth2. 
To authenticate using Basic Authentication, include your username and password in the request headers.

Example

```shell
  Authorization: Basic BASE64_ENCODED_CREDENTIALS
 
```

## OAuth2 with Token

OAuth2 with Token is the recommended authentication method. it provides a more secure and flexible way to authenticate API requests. 

## Obtaining an Access Token

To authenticate using OAuth2, follow these steps
1. Authorization Request: Redirect the user to the authorization endpoint.
2. User Authentication: The user provides their credentials and authoritzes the application.
3. Access Token Request: Exchange the authorization grant for an access token.
4. Using the Access Token: Include the access token in the Authrozation header of each request.

Example

```shell

   Authorization: Bearer ACCESS_TOKEN
 
```

## Security Considerations

To authenticate using OAuth2, follow these steps
- Always use HTTPS to encrypt data transmission.
- Keep credentials and access tokens confidential.
- Rotate or revoke access token regularly.
- Implement proper error handling for unauthorized access attempts.
