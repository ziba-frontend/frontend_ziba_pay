## Requests

The Pagination feature  allows you to efficiently navigate through large sets of data, such as transactions, ensuring optimal performance and a seamless user experience. When retrieving lists of resources, Pagination divides the data into manageable chunks called "pages," allowing you to fetch only the necessary data at a time.
